<p style="text-align: justify">The 5th generation (5G) wireless communication networks are required to support enhanced spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, peak data rate, mobility, etc. To meet these challenging requirements, 5G systems need to deploy dramatically new cellular architecture and key technologies, such as massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), three-dimensional (3D) MIMO, millimetre wave (mmWave) communications, and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. For the design, performance evaluation, and optimization of 5G wireless communication systems, realistic channel models with good accuracy-complexity-flexibility trade-off are indispensable. The proposed tutorial is intended to offer a comprehensive and in depth crash course to communication professionals and academics, aiming to address recent advances and future challenges for 5G related channel measurements and models. The tutorial will focus on illustrating the channel characteristics and models for four most challenging channel scenarios in 5G, i.e., massive MIMO, mmWave, V2V, and high-speed train communication channels. Also, a unified framework for 5G small-scale fading channel models is also proposed, extending from the 4G standardized channel model with additional features supporting 3D extension, mmWave bands, time evolution or non-stationarity, massive MIMO, high mobility, and V2V scenarios. This unified 5G channel model framework is expected to serve as a good basis for future standardized 5G channel model.</p>
