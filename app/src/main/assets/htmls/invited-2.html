<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Cell-Edge-Aware Precoding for Downlink Massive MIMO Cellular Networks</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Tony Quek, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We propose a cell-edge-aware (CEA) zero forcing (ZF) precoder that exploits the excess spatial degrees of freedom provided by a large number of base station (BS) antennas to suppress inter-cell interference at the most vulnerable user equipments (UEs). We evaluate the downlink performance of CEA-ZF, as well as that of a conventional cell-edge-unaware (CEU) ZF precoder in a network with random base station topology. Our analysis and simulations show that the proposed CEA-ZF precoder outperforms CEU-ZF precoding in terms of (i) aggregate per-cell data rate, (ii) coverage probability, and (iii) 95%-likely, or edge user, rate. This result identifies CEA-ZF as a more effective precoding scheme for massive MIMO cellular networks. Our framework also reveals the importance of scheduling the optimal number of UEs per BS, and confirms the necessity to control the amount of pilot contamination received during the channel estimation phase.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Joint Codebook Assignment and Power Allocation for SCMA Based on Capacity with Gaussian Input</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Wen Chen, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) is a nonorthogonal multi-dimensional spreading technique based on layered codebooks. In SCMA, incoming bits are directly mapped to multi-dimensional codewords of pre-defined codebooks. In comparison to simple repetition of QAM symbols in Low Density Signature (LDS), shaping gain of the multi-dimensional constellation is the main advantage of SCMA for performance improvement. Similar to LDS, SCMA can take the advantage of a near optimal Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) receiver with reasonable complexity. In this paper, the uplink SCMA sum capacity is derived and a specific codebook design method is proposed, which can cancel the effect of the dependency between the non-zero entries of codewords. Under this condition, we study the uplink sum-rate optimization problem. A joint codebook assignment and power allocation method is proposed to achieve a near optimal solution. Simulation results show the significant performance gain of the proposed algorithm.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Beam Training in Millimeter Wave Communication Systems</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Yongming Huang, Southeast University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication recently has attracted increasing attention, as it promises realizing extremely high data rate owing to its abundant spectrum resource. Large antenna array is generally required to combat the severe path loss of mmWave channels. In particular, beam alignment is needed to search the best pairs of transmit and receive beams from a finite space which is usually represented by a beam training codebook. In this talk, we discuss efficient beam training for hybrid digital/analog MIMO mmWave systems. Particularly, we present a new design approach of hierarchical training codebook by shaping the pattern of multi-resolution training beams, by which multi-stage beam alignment can be carried out with high efficiency. We also provide performance analysis and reveal that the probability of missing alignment of this approach decreases exponentially with the increasing of SNR and the number of trainings. Numerical results finally confirm its effectiveness and show that this new approach achieves high accuracy beam alignment even in the low SNR regime.</p>
