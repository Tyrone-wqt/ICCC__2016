<strong>Recent Advance of Fog Computing Based Radio Access Networks for 5G</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Mugen Peng, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Compared with the fourth generation cellular systems, the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems are anticipated to provide spectral and energy efficiency growth by a factor of at least 10, and the area throughput growth by a factor of at least 25. To achieve these goals, a fog computing based radio access network (F-RAN) is presented recently as the advanced wireless access network paradigm, where edge cloud computing is used to fulfill the distributed cooperative processing and delivering the local content for decreasing the latency and burdens on the fronthaul/backhaul. The state-of-the-art research achievements in aspects of system architecture and key technologies for F-RANs are briefly introduced in this talk. In particular, the system architecture evolution from C-RANs and H-CRANs to F-RANs will be discussed, and the key technologies including the edge cache driven performance analysis and cooperative radio resource allocation will be presented. Some challenges and open issues will be discussed.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Fundamental Storage-Latency Tradeoff in Cache-Aided Wireless Interference Networks</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Meixia Tao, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Mobile data traffic has been shifting from connection-centric services, such as voice, e-mails, and web browsing, to emerging content-centric services, such as video streaming, push media, application download/updates, and mobile TV. These contents are typically produced ahead of transmission and can be requested by multiple users at possibly different times. This allows us to cache the contents at base stations or even at user devices during off-peak time, and hence reduce user access latency and alleviating peak-time wireless traffic. A fundamental question is what and how much gain can be leveraged through caching. In this talk, we shall investigate the gain of caching in terms of storage-latency tradeoff in a general wireless interference network with caches equipped at all transmitters (e.g. base stations) and receivers (e.g. user devices). We characterize the tradeoff by an information-theoretic metric, the worst-case fractional delivery time (FDT). We first introduce a novel cooperative transmitter/receiver coded caching strategy. It offers the freedom to adjust file splitting ratios for caching gain optimization. We then present achievable upper bounds of the minimum FDT for the networks with 2 and 3 receivers. We show that receiver local caching gain, coded multicasting gain, and transmitter cooperation gain can be leveraged in different cache size regions by opportunistically turning the interfering network topology into broadcast channel, multicast channel, X channel, or a hybrid form of these channels. We shall also present a theoretical lower bound of the minimum FDT for any number of transmitters and any number of receivers.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Mobility-Aware Caching for Content-Centric Wireless Networks</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Jun Zhang, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hongkong</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">We are witnessing a paradigm shift in wireless networks, from ¡°connection-centric¡± communications to ¡°content-centric¡± communications. Caching popular content at the wireless edge has been proposed as an effective approach to catch this trend. In contrast to wired networks, a unique characteristic of content-centric wireless networks (CCWNs) is the mobility of end users. While it has rarely been considered by existing works, user mobility contains various helpful side information that can be exploited to improve caching efficiency. In this talk, a general framework on mobility-aware caching in CCWNs will be presented. A detailed example on caching placement at mobile devices will also be provided to illustrate the proposed design methodology.</p>
