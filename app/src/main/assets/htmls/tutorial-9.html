<p style="text-align: justify">Almost all currently deployed radios for wireless communications are operated in the half-duplex mode. The recent significant progress in realizing full-duplex (FD) systems has opened up another promising avenue for increasing the capacity of future wireless networks. There is an urgent need to address the diverse set of challenges regarding different aspects of FD network design, theory, and development. In addition to the self-interference cancelation signal processing algorithms and hardware implementation advancement, network protocols such as resource management are also essential in the practical design and implementation of FD wireless networks. This tutorial aims to present the latest development and future directions from physical, MAC, to application layers for different full duplex systems in different domains, including power, space, frequency, and device dimensions. A few representative application scenarios through FD techniques are considered: FD MIMO, FD cooperative systems, FD OFDMA cellular systems, and FD cognitive radio systems. Novel signal processing algorithms and resource management problems in these systems are presented, and key open research directions are discussed.</p>
<p>The tutorial is organized as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Basic of FD Communication</strong> �C presents the basics and recent progress in applying signal processing techniques to design FD communication systems.<br />
1. Overview of wireless communication network evolution<br />
2. Physical-layer transmission technologies: signal model, self-interference cancellation techniques<br />
3. Key working and application scenarios<br />
4. Implementation issues</p>
<p><strong>Resource Allocation</strong> �C discusses the use of optimization and distributed resource allocation such as game theory to theory to analyze and design wireless networks for FD communication networks.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Applications</strong> in FD communication networks�C apply FD concepts into various wireless systems to enable new applications and services.<br />
1. FD for cognitive radio<br />
2. FD for energy harvesting<br />
3. FD for physical-layer security</p>
