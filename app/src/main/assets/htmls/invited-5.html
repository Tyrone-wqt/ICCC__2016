<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Cost Efficiency for Economical Mobile Data Traffic Management from Users¡¯ Perspective</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Lingyang Song, Beijing University, China</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The explosive demand for wireless internet services has posed critical challenges for wireless network due to its limited capacity. To tackle this hurdle, wireless Internet service providers (WISPs) take the smart data pricing to manage the data traffic loads. Meanwhile, from the users¡¯ perspective, it is also reasonable and desired to employ mobile data traffic management under the pricing policies of WISPs to improve the economic efficiency of data consumption. In this talk we introduce a concept of cost efficiency for user¡¯s mobile data management, defined as the ratio of user¡¯s mobile data consumption benefits and its expense. We propose an integrated cost-efficiency-based data traffic management scheme including long-term data demand planning, short-term data traffic pre-scheduling and real-time data traffic management. The real-time data traffic management algorithm is proposed to coordinate user¡¯s data consumption to tailor to the pre-scheduled data traffic profile. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of cost efficiency framework in indicating and motivating mobile user¡¯s data consumption behavior. The proposed management scheme can effectively motivate the user to adjust its data consumption profile to obtain the optimal data consumption cost efficiency.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Load Balancing for Smart Grid Applying Water-Filling Approach</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Lian Zhao, Ryerson University, Canada</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is well-known that power demand is time-varying in a day. Demand Side Management (DSM) is a mechanism to increase the power stability and efficiency by scheduling elastic loads on demand side considering the user¡¯s utility and/or electricity cost. Less power fluctuation in the power system indicates improved efficiency and safety operation of the power grid. Therefore, flattening the power consumLian Zhao, Ryerson University, Canadaption to achieve load balancing via DSM has attracted lots of research attention in recent years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Water-filling (WF) algorithm is a well-known important tool for optimal radio resource management (RRM) in communication systems to maximize channel capacity when power is constrained. In this talk, water-filling approach is proposed to solve load balancing problem. We consider that the users are grouped into different groups. Each user has individual peak power constraint and each group has group peak power constraint due to different restrictions of the power loads used by the users and the groups. It will be shown that the optimal elastic power allocation to minimize the overall load fluctuation has the form of water-filling solution. We decompose the three dimension allocation problems into two dimension problems to gain tractability and provide optimal solutions efficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">The proposed load balancing algorithms possess scalability feature and provide exact optimal solutions based on non-derivative methods, as the implementation of the proposed algorithms invokes neither derivative nor gradient operations. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p>

<h3>Title:<br />
<strong>Transmitting Correlated Sources Using Energy Harvesting Transmitters</strong></h3>
<p>Instructor:<br />
Yunquan Dong, Seoul National University, Korea</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In an energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EH-WSN), an energy harvesting unit is used at each sensor node to collect energy from ambient environments. This provides the network with a perpetual energy supply. However, the intensity of the energy harvesting process is still limited. It is also noted that the collected samples by the sensor nodes are usually correlated with each other. To transmit the samples to the fusion center, they need to be compressed using distributed lossy source coding first.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">In this talk, we consider a basic model in EH-WSNs where two correlated Gaussian sources are transmitted over additive white noise channels (AWGN) by two energy harvesting nodes. Under the squired distortion measure, we minimize the weighted sum-distortion by optimizing the transmit power of each node. By formulating this problem as a standard convex optimization problem, we investigate the structure of the optimal power allocation. Our analysis demonstrates that the transmit power of each node is increasing with the water level associated with itself, which is a monotone increasing function of time, while decreasing with that associated with the other node. To solve the convex optimization problem efficiently, we develop an iterative search algorithm called the iterative generalized backward-water-filling algorithm. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm is highly efficient and can converge to the optimal solution within a few iterations.</p>
