<p style="text-align: justify">This tutorial is composed of three parts. In the first part, Shi Jin will systematically investigate the low-cost massive MIMO wireless communication in cellular networks by considering many important aspects, including hardware cost, power consumption, and computational complexity. In the second part, Feifei Gao will focus on the architecture of transmitters for massive MIMO system and present a concrete scheme of the low cost channel estimation. Based on the efficient fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a spatial basis expansion model (SBEM) is introduced to represent the channels with much less parameter dimensions. In the third part, Chao-Kai Wen will focus on the architecture of receivers for massive MIMO systems, especially issues with low-cost transceivers. We also highlight the open issues and research directions to this topic.</p>
