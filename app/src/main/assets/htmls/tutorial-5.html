<p style="text-align: justify">In this tutorial, we provide an overview for the recent advances in wireless localization, in particular from the physical-layer perspective of theory and algorithm design. Starting from the basic models and concepts of wireless localization, we overview the state-of-the-art results on non-cooperative and cooperative wireless localization. Then, we introduce network operation techniques for wireless localization in both noncooperative and cooperative scenarios. Emphasis will be given to resource-restricted wireless localization networks, and as an example, we will discuss joint power and bandwidth allocation for cooperative localization. Finally, we introduce recent advances in receiver positioning, where the full-duplex relay are used.</p>
