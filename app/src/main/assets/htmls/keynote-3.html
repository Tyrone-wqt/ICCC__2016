<h3 style="text-align: center">5G is Coming</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> It is envisioned that 5G will embrace machine to machine and machine to human communication in addition to human to human communication. To enable this vision, extreme high throughput, ultra low latency/high reliability and massive connectivity are the design target of 5G. This talk will present the framework and a set of enabling technologies to build such a system including some latest Huawei&#8217;s field trial efforts and results. In addition, a high level view of standardization efforts will be given to provide a roadmap toward the commercialization of 5G system.</p>
