<p style="text-align: justify">Over the past decade there has been considerable progress in the interdisciplinary field of nanoscale and molecular communication systems, motivated by rapid advances in NEMS, lab/process-on-a-chip, systems biology, as well as nanorobotics. Recent progress in this field has promised the prospect of realizing nanorobotic communication and sensor networks (NCSN), where the nanobots are both green (i.e., biocompatible and biodegradable) and touchable (i.e., externally controllable and trackable). All these attempts open up a new frontier for interdisciplinary communication techniques using robotics, chemistry, biology, and other principles that have not been considered in the existing classical literature. As this research area is still in its infancy and in view of its great potential for wireless communication and sensing, environmental, biological, medical, and many other applications, a tutorial on this topic would be very timely and relevant in order to raise awareness in this area and introduce the latest standardization efforts and R&amp;D activities to the research community. We will cover all the topics mentioned above in the proposed tutorial.</p>
