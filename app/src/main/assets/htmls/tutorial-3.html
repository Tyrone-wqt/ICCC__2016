<p style="text-align: justify">Vehicular communications and networking is an area of significant importance in our increasingly connected and mobile world. In the past decade, this area has gained significant attention from both industry and academia for its potential of ensuring road safety, improving transportation efficiency and of enhancing travel quality. Vehicular environments are inherently challenging with doubly selective physical channels, constrained radio spectrum bandwidth resources, and constantly changing network connectivity and topology. As such, research in this area is essential for bringing to reality the many demanding vehicular applications that consist of the gateway towards the ultimate connected mobility. In this tutorial, fundamentals of vehicular channels will be comprehensively analyzed, based on which various practical communications and networking techniques will be introduced. Challenges and opportunities in this field will also be discussed to stimulate future research and development from various industry and academia sectors.</p>
